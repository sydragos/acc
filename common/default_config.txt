# Advanced Charging Controller (acc) Configuration
# /data/media/0/acc/config.txt


capacity=5,60,77-80 # <shutdown,coolDown,resume-pause> -- ideally, <resume> shouldn't be more than 10 units below <pause>. To disable <shutdown>, and <coolDown>, set these to 0 and 101, respectively (e.g., capacity=0,101,70-80). Note that the latter doesn't disable the cooling feature entirely, since it works not only based on battery capacity, but temperature as well.

coolDown=50/10 # Charge/pause ratio (in seconds) -- reduces battery temperature and voltage induced stress by periodically pausing charging. This can be disabled with a null value or a preceding hashtag. If charging is too slow, turn this off or change the charge/pause ratio. Disabling this nullifies <coolDown capacity> and <lower temperature> values -- leaving only a temperature limit with a cooling timeout.

temp=400-450_90 # <coolDown-pauseCharging_wait> -- <wait> is interpreted in seconds and it allows battery temperature to drop below <pauseCharging>. By default, temperature values are interpreted in <degrees Celsius times 10>. To disable temperature control entirely, set absurdly high temperature values (e.g., temp=900-950_90).

verbose=false # Alpha and Beta versions will generate verbose whether or not this is enabled.

resetUnplugged=false # Reset battery stats every time charger is unplugged, as opposed to only when max battery capacity is reached.

loopDelay=10 # Time interval between loops, in seconds -- do not change this unless you know exactly what you're doing!

maxLogSize=5 # Log size limit in Megabytes -- when exceeded, $log becomes $log.old. This prevents storage space hijacking.

switch= # Custom charging switch parameters (<path> <onValue> <offValue>), e.g., switch=/sys/class/power_supply/battery/charging_enabled 1 0, pro tip: <./> can be used in place of </sys/class/power_supply/> (e.g., switch=./battery/charging_enabled 1 0).

onBoot= # These settings are applied on boot. e.g., ./usb/device/razer_charge_limit_enable:1 ./usb/device/razer_charge_limit_max:80 ./usb/device/razer_charge_limit_dropdown:70 /sys/kernel/fast_charge/force_fast_charge:1

onBootExit=false # Exit after applying "onBoot" settings from above. Enabling this is particularly useful if voltage_max or similar is being set -- since keeping accd running in such cases is usually redundant.

onPlugged=./wireless/voltage_max:9000000 # These settings are applied every time an external power supply is connected. e.g., ./wireless/voltage_max:9000000 ./usb/current_max:2000000

cVolt=./?attery/voltage_max:4199 # Used by <acc -v millivolts> command for setting charging voltage. This is automatically applied on boot. <acc -v file:millivolts> overrides the value set here -- e.g., "acc -v ./main/voltage_max:4050". For convenience and safety, voltage unit is always millivolt (mV). Only the first four digits of the original value are modified. The accepted voltage range is 3920-4199mV. "acc -v" restores the default value and "acc -v -" shows the current voltage. "acc -v :" lists available charging voltage control files. "acc -v :millivolts" is for evaluating charging voltage control files.

selfUpgrade=true # Automatically check for a new release, download and install it - minutes after daemon is started/restarted. This has virtually no impact on mobile data. It runs only once per boot session. Update zips weigh only a few kilobytes.

rebootOnPause= # After set seconds (disabled if null).

vNow= # Pause charging for _seconds when charging voltage (voltage_now) >= mV_ (e.g., 4150_15). This is an alternative to charging voltage control. However, in order to actually benefit from it, the charging current must be low (e.g., 500-1000mA). You can use onPlugged=./usb/current_max:500000 or similar configuration, or a low current power supply to achieve that. The higher the current, the less effective this is. That is because battery voltage raises quicker with higher charging current.
